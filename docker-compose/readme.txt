This is created for initializing the Apache Tomcat and the MySQL server (there are some pre-filled data, the server is initialized by a mysql dump file).

To run these servers just navigate to this folder and run via terminal "docker compose up" and wait till it gets initialized.
If the mysql welcome text appears, the Desktop application (LibraryAppDesktop.jar) can be run.
I tested this in Windows and Ubuntu too, worked for me.
